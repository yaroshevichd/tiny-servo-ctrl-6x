It's a try to make PWM controller on X channel using AVR MCU. MCU communication is I2C.

At local market ATtiny44A is cheapeast one, plus it have enough pins to drive 6 servos, communicate using TWI, and 3 pins to custimze address. So it's possible to drive up to (2^3 - 1) * 6 = 42 servo, which is more than enough for my requirements.
